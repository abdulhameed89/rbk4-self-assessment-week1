## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.
Both of them are data structures and both of them are taking the values one by one but the difference is:
##The queue:
- the first in the queue is the first out,
- for example the ticket number that you take when you go to Zain center First in First Out (FIFO)
##The Stack:
- the last in first out,
- for example when you have a stack of plates so the last in first out (LIFO)
